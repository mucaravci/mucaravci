- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mucaravci

I am an econometrics ma (who is trying to finish up his thesis) interested in ml and computer aided econometrics/statistical modelling.
my specialty is nonlinear time series analysis and i wish to interpret the latest developments in financial modelling and econometrics
into python and r, and incorporate them into ml/statistical inference algorithms.
Unfortunately, I cannot update my repos as much as I'd like to atm, but as soon as I am done with my thesis 
I intend to brush up on my skills and get back in the game :D
